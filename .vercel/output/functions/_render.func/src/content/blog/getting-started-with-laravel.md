# Getting Started with Laravel: A Beginner's Guide

Laravel is a powerful PHP framework for web application development. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and starting a new Laravel project.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- PHP (7.3 or higher)
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend assets)

## Step 1: Installing Laravel

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install Laravel globally:

   ```
   composer global require laravel/installer
   ```

## Step 2: Creating a New Laravel Project

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

   ```
   laravel new my-project
   ```

   Replace `my-project` with your desired project name.

3. Once the installation is complete, navigate into your project directory:

   ```
   cd my-project
   ```

## Step 3: Configure the Environment

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root directory.
2. Configure your database settings:

   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

1. In your project directory, run the following command:

   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. Your Laravel application should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Step 5: Exploring Laravel's Structure

Laravel follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Here's a brief overview of the main directories:

- `app/`: Contains the core code of your application
- `config/`: All of your application's configuration files
- `database/`: Database migrations and seeders
- `public/`: The entry point for all requests entering your application
- `resources/`: Views, raw assets (SASS, JS, etc), and language files
- `routes/`: All route definitions for your application

## Step 6: Creating Your First Route

1. Open `routes/web.php`.
2. Add a new route:

   ```php
   Route::get('/hello', function () {
       return 'Hello, Laravel!';
   });
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000/hello` in your browser to see your new route in action.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've set up your first Laravel project. Here are some next steps to continue your Laravel journey:

1. Learn about Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database operations
2. Explore Blade templating for creating views
3. Understand Laravel's authentication system
4. Dive into Laravel's documentation for more advanced features

Happy coding with Laravel!
